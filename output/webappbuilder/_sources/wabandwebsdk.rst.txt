Web App Builder and WebSDK
===========================

The |current_plugin| (WAB) acts as a front end for the `Boundless WebSDK <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/suite/sdk/latest/>`_. Applications generated by WAB are not complete apps that can be published directly into a web server. Instead, the ouput files created by WAB will have to be built using `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_ and the *Boundless WebSDK*.

WebSDK allows to create `OpenLayers 3 <http://openlayers.org/>`_ (OL3) based web applications in a much easier and productive way than using plain JavaScript and OL3 from scratch, but it requires knowledge of JavaScript and coding experience. With WAB, no coding experience is needed, and all the code that uses the WebSDK components is written by WAB according to what the user defines in the WAB UI. That code, however, has to be later built using Node.js and WebSDK, just as it would happen if you were coding a WebSDK-based app without WAB. Please check `WebSDK Documentation <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/suite/sdk/latest/wab.html>`_ for instructions on how to build a App created by WAB.

The :guilabel:`preview` button in WAB allows you to see a fully-working preview of your web app. It is created in a temporary folder, and you can use the files in that temporary folder for your application, without having to build anything using Node.js or WebSDK. 

.. warning::
   
   **The preview mechanism is not suitable for production-ready applications**, since it uses a prebuilt copy of the full WebSDK. Whish means that the applications has a very large dependency (5+MB) and its performance is limited due to how the library is used and included in the app. 

   Therefore, **using the preview application for anything other than previewing** the final web app appearance **is not recommended**.
