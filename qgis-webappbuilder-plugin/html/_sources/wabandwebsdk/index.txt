Web App Builder and WebSDK
===========================

The Web App Builder (WAB) acts as a front end for the Boundless WebSDK. Applications generated by WAB are not complete apps that can be published directly into a web server. Instead, the ouput files created by WAB have to be built using Node.js and the Boundless WebSDK.

WebSDK allows to create OL3-based web applications in a much easier and productive way than using plain JavaScript and OL3 from scratch, but it requires knowledge of JavaScript and coding experience. With WAB, no coding experience is needed, and all the code that uses the WebSDK components is written by WAB according to what the user defines in the WAB UI. That code, however, has to be later built using Node and WebSDK, just as it would happen if you were coding a WebSDK-based app without WAB.

The preview button in WAB allows you to see a fully-working preview of your web app. It is created in a temporary folder, and you can use the files in that temporary folder for your application, without having to build anything using Node or WebSDK. However, the mechanism is not suitable for production-ready applications, since it uses a prebuilt copy of the full WebSDK. That means that the applications has a very large dependency (5+MB) and its performance is limited due to how the library is used and included in the app. Using the preview app for anything other than previewing the final app appearance is, thus, not recommended.
