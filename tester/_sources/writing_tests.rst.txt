Writing tests
=============

Instructions to write new tests are described in this document

To write a new set of tests, add a python module file in the *tests* folder of the plugin. The module can have two functions, to define unit tests (automated) and functional tests (semi-automated):  *functionalTests()* and *unitTests()*. None of these functions is mandatory. The plugin will look for them and, if found, will call them to retrieve the tests declared by the module.

Plugins can add their tests suite to this tester plugin by using the addTestModule() function.

In your plugin *__init__* method add something like this:

::

    try:
        from qgistester.tests import addTestModule
        addTestModule(testmodule, "Name_of_my_plugin")
    except:
        pass

Unit Tests
***********

Unit tests are created wrapping a python test suite. Create your test suite in the usual Python way and then return it from the *unitTests()* method.

The test description shown in the test selector dialog is taken from the test's ``shortDescription()`` method, which takes the first line of the docstring, so if you want to add a name to your test, just add a one-line dosctring in it. If no docstring is present, the test method name is used.

Functional Tests
*****************

Functional tests are defined using the *Test* class from the qgistester.test module. Here is an example of a test

::

	vectorRenderingTest = Test("Verify rendering of uploaded style")
	vectorRenderingTest.addStep("Preparing data", _openAndUpload)
	vectorRenderingTest.addStep("Check that WMS layer is correctly rendered")
	vectorRenderingTest.setCleanup(_clean)

To add a step to the test, the *addStep()* method is used. It accepts four parameters: ``description, function, prestep, isVerifyStep``.

The first one is mandatory and is a string with the description of the test. The second one is optional and should be a function. If this parameters is passed, the function will be executed at that step, and it will be an automated step. If no function is passed, the step will be considered a manual one. The description will be shown to the user and he will perform the step manually.

If once the manual step has been performed, the tester has to verify something, the ``isVerifyStep`` parameter should receive True. That will cause the "Step passes" and "Step fails" buttons to be active, instead of the simple "Next step" one.

If you require a prestep to be executed before actually entering this step, pass the corresponding function using the ``prestep`` parameters.

You can add a cleanup task to be performed when the test is finished (or skipped), by using the *setCleanup()* method and passing a function where the cleanup is to be performed.

Issue URL
*********

You can define a issue URL for each test, using the ``Test.setIssueURL(url)`` method, in case you are using a testinbg platform to keep track of test executions.
