Writing Lessons
===============

This document describes how to write new lessons that users can read and
followed using the Lessons plugin. Lessons can be created in two "flavours",
Python and YAML. The document explains both.

.. _lesson_structure:

Lessons group's file structure
------------------------------

Lessons are usually deployed in lessons groups or packages. Therefore is
advisable to start by creating a new folder to hold your lessons and add
an empty :file:`__init__.py` file to it. Then, for each lesson, create a
separate folder with the structure shown below:

::

    lessons_group/
    |-- lesson_1/
    |   |-- __init__py (or lesson.yaml)
    |   |-- project.qgs
    |   |-- [html or markdown files and images describing the lesson and each step in it]
    |   |-- data/
    |   |   |-- [data files used in the lesson]
    |
    |-+ lesson_2/
    |-+ lesson_3/
    |-- __init__.py (empty)
    |-- group.html (or group.md)
    |-- lesson.manifest
    |-- style.css


All these elements are explained in the next sections of this document.

Setting up a group
------------------

Having an empty :file:`__init__.py` at the root of the groupâ€™s folder is
mandatory.

The group's name is taken from the parent folder name (replacing underscores
with spaces), so you should make sure that this folder name matches the
declared group name of each of the lessons under it.

Optionally, you can provide a group description by adding a :file:`group.html`
or :file:`group.md` (markdown) file in the group folder, and it will be
automatically assigned as the description file for the group. This
description will be shown in the :guilabel:`Lessons Library` when the group
is selected.

The :file:`lesson.manifest` is also optional, and it is used for group
packaging and deployment in `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo
.com/>`_. Here's an example of a manifest file:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes'?>
   <lesson>
     <description>Lessons about general/common tasks in QGIS</description>
     <lessons_list>[lessons]</lessons_list>
     <url>http://lessons.connect.boundlessgeo.com/general.zip</url>
   </lesson>

Please note the ``[lessons]`` placeholder. It will be replaced by the
group's list of lessons, taken from their folders names (replacing
underscores with spaces).

The :file:`style.css` is another optional file, that allows to set up a common
CSS/HTML style for all lessons's steps within the group. The declarations on
this file will be appended to each html or markdown files used for step
description during the lessons' run time.

Creating a lesson in Python
---------------------------

If you have created a folder for each lesson as described above, the steps of
the lesson and the content of each step should be defined in the
:file:`__init__.py` file.

The :file:`__init__.py` must start by importing the Lessons plugin's methods.

.. code-block:: python

   from lessons.lesson import Lesson, Step
   from lessons.utils import *
   from qgis.utils import iface

Then, create a ``Lesson`` object, specifying its name, the group it belongs
to (lessons can be grouped) and a detailed description.

.. code-block:: python

   lesson = Lesson ("Interpolating from a points layer", "Analysis lessons",
                    "This lesson shows how to use the interpolation capabilities of QGIS")

Instead of a string with the description, you can pass the name of an HTML
file containing a richer description. For instance:

.. code-block:: python

   lesson = Lesson ("Interpolating from a points layer", "Analysis lessons",
                    "lesson.html")


There is no need to add the full path to the description file. As long as the
file is in the same folder as the :file:`__init__.py` file, the full path
will be correctly resolved at runtime.

You can also use Markdown files (with the ``md`` extension) instead of HTML
files. They will be converted to HTML code automatically by the lessons plugin
itself.

.. note::

   The HTML files used to describe the lesson or its steps can be formatted
   using the most common HTML tags and styling options, including titles,
   images, paragraphs, ordered lists, etc., but there are some limitations.
   Consult Qt4.8 framework documentation for more details on the
   `supported HTML subset <http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/richtext-html-subset.html>`_.

Preload a project
.................

If your lesson requires loading data into QGIS, you can prepare a project
with that data. Name the project :file:`project.qgs` and put it in the
lesson folder as well, as indicated. Put all data in the sub-folder named
``data`` and load it into the project. Please make sure you save the project
using relative paths. Having a :file:`project.qgs` file in the folder will
cause the lesson to automatically have a first step that loads the data
before starting with the rest of the lesson. If you want your data to be
loaded from a different project in another folder, or to load it in the
middle of the lesson, you will have to add that step manually.

Adding steps
............

Now, you can add steps to your lesson using the ``addStep`` method, which has
the following signature:

.. code-block:: python

   addStep(self, name, description, function=None, prestep=None,
           endsignals=None, endsignalchecks=None, endcheck=lambda:True,
           steptype=1):

Here is a description of its arguments:

- **name**: the name of the step, to be shown in the Lessons Panel index when
  running the lesson.
- **description**: a longer description of the step. As in the case of the
  lesson description, it can be a string containing the description, or a
  string containing the name of an HTML file with the description itself.
- **function**: the function that execute this step. Even in the case of steps
  that are supposed to be performed manually by the user, a function can be
  supplied which performs the same action. In this case, the *Run step*
  button will be available, so the user can have the step automatically
  executed, instead of having to do it manually. If the step is a manual step
  and there is no function to perform the task, ``None`` can be passed
- **prestep**: a function to be executed before starting the step, for
  preparing the necessary context. Should be ``None`` if no preparation is
  needed
- **endsignals**: a signal (or a list of signals) that indicates that the step
  has been finished. If not ``None``, the plugin will listen to the passed
  signals, and when it is emitted, it will automatically move to the next step.
- **endsignalchecks**: in case it is needed to check that the *endsignals*
  signal(s) should cause moving to the next step, pass a function
  (or a list of function) to do the checking using this parameters. Should be
  used if the signal might be emitted in cases that do not represent the
  end of the step. Should be ``None`` if no check has to be performed.
- **endcheck**: a function to check that the step has been executed correctly.
  This function will be run when the lesson moves to the next step. It should
  return ``True`` if the user has correctly performed the task for this
  step, or false otherwise. In this last case, the plugin will show a
  warning message and won't let the user move to the next step until the
  step is correctly completed.
- **steptype**: ``Step.MANUALSTEP`` if the step is to be performed
  manually by the user, or ``Step.AUTOMATEDSTEP`` if it's an automated one.
  In this last case, the step will not be shown in the lesson panel's index,
  and it is required to pass a function using the ``function`` argument.

Convenience methods and utils
.............................

To make it easier to create new lessons, you will find some convenience
methods in the ``Lesson`` class and functions for performing common tasks
in the ``lessons.utils`` module.

The ``addMenuClickStep()`` method in the ``Lesson`` class will add a
step that involves clicking a menu item. Its only mandatory argument is the
path and name of the menu to click. This method will add a step with a
standard name and description, and that will automatically move to the next
step once that specified menu item is clicked.

.. code-block:: python

   lesson.addMenuClickStep("Layer/Create Layer/Create New Shapefile Layer...")

Optionally, you can provide a custom description, either as a string of text
or a description file (HTML or Markdown).

.. code-block:: python

   lesson.addMenuClickStep("Layer/Create Layer/Create New Shapefile Layer...", "create_shapefile.html")


The ``addMenuClickStep()`` method is particularly useful when a step
involves opening a modal dialog that will block QGIS's main window and will
not allow the user to move to the next step and see its description.

Another convenient method is the ``setCleanup()``. With it you can set up a
cleanup method, which will run when the lesson is finished, or the user exits
the lesson before completing it.

.. code-block:: python

   lesson.setCleanup(cleanupMethod)

Yet another useful method is ``addNextLesson()``. If your lesson is related
to other lessons, you can add them as recommended lesson to continue after the
current one is finished.

.. code-block:: python

   lesson.addNextLesson("Lessons Group", "Name of the lesson")

The name and group name must match the name and group name of the lesson that
you want to add. Ideally, those lessons should be in the same lessons group as
the current lesson to ensure that they are installed and available as well.

The ``lessons.utils`` module also include a couple of methods to use in
``endsignals``, ``endsignalchecks``, and ``endcheck`` arguments of the
``addStep()``:

.. automodule:: utils
   :members: layerActive, setActiveLayer, layerExists, checkLayerCrs

Python example
..............

The *Lessons plugin* includes a simple lesson written in python.
Here's its :file:`__init__.py` file as an example.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examplelessons/_lessons/exporttogeojson/__init__.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 6-


Creating simple lessons with YAML files
---------------------------------------

Lessons can also be created using YAML files, allowing those with no Python
experience to create their lessons. Instead of a :file:`__init__.py` file,
you will need a :file:`lesson.yaml` file. The remaining file structure of the
lesson's folder is the same as shown before.

Lessons created using YAML files cannot content automated routines, such as
``presteps`` or methods to check if the step was correctly performed before
moving to the next one. Instead, they are just a collection of steps, each
of them with an associated description.

Nevertheless, some simple automation is still possible. For instance, the
lesson will start by opening the :file:`project.qgs` if it exists in the
lesson folder. There is ``menu`` step type that, as before, will create a
standard description based on the menu path and name, and will move to the
next step once the menu is clicked. Moreover, you can suggest the user related
lessons for him to follow.

YMAL example
............

The Lessons plugin also includes a simple lesson based in a YAML file. It
is actually the same lesson that is included as a Python example, although
it doesn't contain some of the elements in that one, such as automatically
running some steps, since those are not available in this case, as
explained before.

Here's the lesson YAML file, with comments to explain its content:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examplelessons/_lessons/exporttogeojsonyaml/lesson.yaml
   :language: yaml

Capturing QGIS interaction to create a lesson
---------------------------------------------

The lessons steps' descriptions contain text and usually screenshots. These
have to be created manually, by creating the corresponding html and image files.

An additional plugin is included in `this repository <https://github
.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-lessons-plugin>`_, in the ``lessonscreator``
folder, aimed at users that plan to create their own lessons. It simplifies
both writing text and creating screenshots, by capturing actions performed
in QGIS. That is, the user performs the steps in the lesson to create, and
the plugin tries to create the corresponding lesson files automatically.

.. note::

   The *Lessons Creator* plugin is NOT installed with the *Lessons Plugin*
   by default. You need to install it manually.

To create a new lesson, go to the :menuselection:`Plugins --> Lessons -->
Capture lesson steps` menu. Select a folder to store the lessons data.

From that moment, the plugin will be listening to your actions and
documenting them according to the following ideas:

- Whenever the focus changes to a new window, a screenshot of the window
  will be taken. An entry in the html file describing the current step will
  be added, which will include the screenshot.

- Whenever the focus changes between two elements (but both of them having
  the same parent window/dialog), and the one that receives the focus is an
  input widget (text box, dropdown list, etc.), a screenshot of the new
  element that receives the focus will be taken. The element that receives
  the focus will be highlighted in the screenshot using a red dashed
  rectangle, as shown in the image below

    .. figure:: img/rectangle.png

  The image will be added to the HTML file corresponding to the current
  step, along with a text entry in the form "Click on [widget_name]"

- When edit widgets lose focus or are modified, the plugin will try to
  capture the user action. For instance, for a dropdown list, when the
  current value is changed, the text "Select [new_value_text] in the
  [dropdown_name] dropdown list" is added. In the case of text boxes, the
  text "Enter [text] in the [textbox_name] textbox" is added.

- When a menu item is clicked, the text "Select the [menu_text] menu" will
  be added.

All texts snippets and screenshots are added to the HTML file that
describes the current step. A lesson might contain several steps. To start
a new step and add text and screenshots to another file, press :kbd:`Ctrl +
w` (:kbd:`Cmd + w` in Mac OS) at any time, and a new step will be started.

When you have captured all elements of your lesson, go to
:menuselection:`Plugins --> Lessons --> Stop capturing lesson steps` menu
item.

In the folder that you selected, you will find all html and image files.
You will also find a ```__init.py__``` file that describes the lesson. The
folder as it is generated can be loaded in *Lessons plugin* and will be
recognized as a valid lesson. Nevertheless, you may want to edit it to get
a more polished lesson.

Deploy Lessons as a plugin
--------------------------

You can deploy a lesson or a group of lessons as a QGIS plugin that
you can share using a plugin repository. Alternatively, you can add lessons to an
existing plugin to explain how to use it. In these cases, you need to add
some extra commands in the lessons creation.

The recommended procedure for adding new lessons is as follows:

#. First, create a new python plugin (you can use QGIS plugins developing
   `guidelines <http://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook
   /plugins.html>`_). This plugin will be responsible for registering the
   lessons so that they will appear in the :guilabel:`Lessons Library` list.

#. For each lesson, create a separate folder with the same basic structure
   explained `before <lesson_structure>`_. You can use either Python-based or
   YAML-based lesson.

#. In the ``init`` method of your plugin, register your plugin adding the
   following snippet:

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
          from lessons import addLessonModule
          addLessonModule(lesson_module)
      except:
          pass

   Replace *lesson_module* with the reference to your lesson module (which you
   should have imported), and add as many entries as modules you have created
   in your set of lessons.

   If your plugin contains several lessons, there is no need to call the
   ``addLessonModule`` method repeatedly. You can use the
   ``addLessonsFolder`` method and pass the path to the folder that contains
   the lesson subfolders.

#. You can provide a group description using the ``addGroup(name,
   description)`` method from the ``lessons`` module in your plugin's ``init``
   method. The description, as before, can be a text block with html code, or
   the path to an existing HTML or Markdown file.

#. In the ``unload`` method of your plugin, you should remove the lessons
   using the ``removeLessonModule`` or ``removeLessonsFolder`` methods:

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
          from lessons import removeLessonsFolder
      except:
          return

      removeLessonsFolder(lesson_folder)

   An example of a plugin that adds a collection of lessons can be found in
   the ``examplelessons`` folder of `this repository <https://github
   .com/boundlessgeo/qgis-lessons-plugin>`_. Use is as a template for your
   own collections. Using it, you do not have to call the
   ``addLessonModule()`` method manually. The plugin will automatically
   discover all available lessons. The only thing you have to do is to add
   your lessons under the ``_lessons`` subfolder, each of them in its
   corresponding subfolder, as described above.
