Web App Builder and WebSDK
==========================

The |current_plugin| (WAB) acts as a front end for the `Boundless WebSDK
<https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/suite/sdk/latest/>`_. Applications are
generated by WAB in two steps:

- First, JSX files are created by WAB in the selected folder, containing the
  main elements of the application. Layer data and styles are also saved
  along with the JSX files. These files are not a complete app that can be
  published directly into a web server. Instead, the ouput files created by
  WAB will have to be built using `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_ and the
  *Boundless WebSDK*.

- Second, files are built using the *Boundless WebSDK*. This is done by
  zipping the output folder and sending it to the WebSDK service. Since this
  is not a public service, you will need to enter your Boundless credentials
  to be able to use it. The service compiles the JSX files and returns a
  ready-to-be-deployed web app. The returned app is stored in the output folder.

The original JSX files are kept in the ouput folder, so advanced users can
edit them or manually process them if they have WebSDK installed locally,
without having to use the WebSDK service. Please check `WebSDK Documentation
<https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/suite/sdk/latest/wab.html>`_ for
instructions on how to build an app manually.

Problems using the WebSDK Service
---------------------------------

Problems might arise when using the WebSDK Service:

- **Timeouts**: If the services takes too long to process the web app files, a
  server timeout might occur. You can avoid that by setting a larger timeout
  in the QGIS settings (check `here <https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#network-menu>`_
  to see how to do it)


Preview
-------

The :guilabel:`preview` button in WAB allows you to see a fully-working
preview of your web app. It is created in a temporary folder, and you can
use the files in that temporary folder for your application, without having
to build anything using WebSDK. Connection to the Internet is not needed,
since the WebSDK service is not used. Credentials are also not needed.

.. warning::
   
   **The preview mechanism is not suitable for production-ready
   applications**, since it uses a prebuilt copy of the full WebSDK. Whish
   means that the applications has a very large dependency (5+MB) and its
   performance is limited due to how the library is used and included in the app.

   Therefore, **using the preview application for anything other than
   previewing** the final web app appearance **is not recommended**.
