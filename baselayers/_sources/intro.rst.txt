Click on the menu entry corresponding to the layer that you want to add, and
it will be added to your current project.

Not all layers will be shown the first time you run the plugin. Some providers might require additional information, such as user credentials or an access token. To configure them, use the settings window. To open it, select the Settings option from the menu. You will see the following dialog:

Credentials and access tokens do not have to be entered each time you start QGIS. Once entered,
they are safely stored in the user keyring, and the plugin will automatically
connect using the credentials used in the last session.

Once you close the settings window, the list of available layers in the "Add Base layer menu" will be updated.
